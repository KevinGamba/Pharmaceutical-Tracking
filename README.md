# Project Name: MediTrack

## Pharmaceutical-Tracking
An AI-powered blockchain platform for tracking the availability of medicines across pharmacies. Patients can search for
prescribed medications and receive them from the nearest available pharmacy, ensuring timely access to healthcare.

### Problem Statement:
In Kenya and many other countries, patients face difficulties in finding specific medications, especially after relocating.
The process of manually searching pharmacies for medication availability is time-consuming and frustrating. 
This is particularly concerning for patients with rare conditions who require specific drugs.

### Approach:
Using the Aptos blockchain, a decentralized application (dApp) can be created that allows patients to query pharmacies for medication availability in real-time.
By using the geolocation feature, the system can pinpoint the nearest pharmacies that have the required medication in stock, reducing the time and effort involved.
The dApp could also leverage AI to predict restock times and allow users to set alerts for when a particular medicine becomes available.

### Vision:
To ensure that every patient, regardless of location, can access vital medications promptly, leading to better health outcomes and reduced stress.
This will also benefit pharmacies by enhancing their stock management and customer satisfaction.

### Technologies/Tools:

- Aptos Blockchain: To securely store and verify transactions.
  
- AI for Predictive Analysis: To predict restock times and trends in medication availability.
  
- Geolocation APIs: For tracking nearby pharmacies.
  
- Move Smart Contracts: To manage transactions between users and pharmacies.
  
- Front-end UI: A simple mobile-friendly interface for users to interact with.

  ### Scalability:
Once proven in Kenya, the solution can be expanded globally, especially in regions with similar challenges. 
Integrating with hospital systems and medical insurance providers could further expand its utility.
